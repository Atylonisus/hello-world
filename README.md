# hello-world
A time honored tradition, and also a tutorial for how to use this site

I am a person who learns discipline through repetition and misery.
Being frustrated means there is something I have not mastered
I welcome mastery, therefore I welcome discipline and in turn, frustration getting there.

There can be no change without sacrifice
